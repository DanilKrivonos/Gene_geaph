#Idea of this project is to make graph structure of genome more clear and more readable. Gene graph uses synteny blocks as nodes, it help us to meke complexity lower.

#Mauve_backboner

Use this to make backbone file from mauve.

#Pars_mauve

To find syntheny blocks, we uses programm mauve .To make file for mauve  more clear ( make matrix.txt file for Gene_graph_maker.py)

#Gene_graph_maker.py

The utiles, wich uses to make graph structure and .dot file. It takes .txt files attribute (example fo type of file evirt4matrix.txt). Script gives two files .dot and .png (exmple evirt4dot.dot and evirt4graph.png).
